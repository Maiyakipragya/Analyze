        ## Summary
        This project was auto-generated for the TDS Project 1 in response to the brief:
        "You are given two attachments: execute.py and data.xlsx.

- Commit execute.py after fixing the non-trivial error in it.
- Ensure it runs on Python 3.11+ with Pandas 2.3.
- Convert data.xlsx to data.csv and commit it.
- Add a GitHub Actions push workflow at .github/workflows/ci.yml that:
  - Runs ruff and shows its results in the CI log
  - Runs: python execute.py > result.json
  - Publishes result.json via GitHub Pages
- Do not commit result.json; it must be generated in CI."

        ## Usage
        This is a static site. The deployed version is available via GitHub Pages.

        ## Code Explanation
        The `index.html` file is a self-contained application generated by an LLM. 
        Any attachments, like `data.csv`, are fetched by the HTML file.
